While Cold storages (Long term storage and distribution hubs) up to 5000 MT capacity will be promoted under NHM/HMNEH sub-schemes (Annexure V)”.\n\nFurther, The cost norms and pattern of assistant under mission for MIDH during XII during plan for National Horticulture Mission (NHM) and Horticulture Mission for north East and Himalayan States (HMNEH) sub Schemes under Annexure-V C.6 provides the cost and pattern of assistance in respect of the Cold storage units which is as follows:\n\nRefer - Table 5\n\nDuring the test check of the record, the audit noticed that the HDNHMS disbursed the subsidy under the “Cold Storage Units Type 2 with add on technology for Controlled Atmosphere” to the beneficiary as detailed below.\n\nRefer - Table 10\n\nFurther scrutiny of the records revels that the The Ludhiana District Horticulture Mission Society,(TLDHMS) gave the subsidy for the part of the item i.e. for add on technology for controlled atmosphere ( for installation of solar panel) instead of the whole item as detailed in the guidelines. Further, the beneficiaries to whom the subsidies paid never availed any subsidy for cold storage under the scheme. As per the guidelines of the MIDH the subsidy is to be paid for the whole component not for part of the component. Subsidy for the add on components may be given to the existing beneficiary those who have availed the subsidy for cold store or to those beneficiaries who go for the whole project as mentioned in the guidelines of MIDH,2014.\n\nThus, payment of Rs. 874000- as subsidy amount to beneficiaries renders the expenditure as inadmissible.
